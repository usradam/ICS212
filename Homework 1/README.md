# ICS 212 - Homework 1

## 📒 Java to C [5 pts]
You are going to convert Java code to C code. This assignment also includes instructions to work on UH Unix.

Please follow the instructions below. Unless additional instructions are given, you will basically do the same for later assignments.

🔰 **Note**: Homework 1 gives step-by-step instructions for you to follow. However, the later assignments will not always give this kind of information. They will basically just provide "requirements." That is, you will need to bother understanding what you are doing and what you really need to do to achieve them.

## 0. READING
Read these parts of the textbook:
- Sections **1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 7.2, B1.2**
  
## 1. Learn how to access UH Unix
Please refer to How to Acceess UH Unix and Use Commands. The instructions are different for the OS of your local machine. After that, you are supposed to be able to upload/download files and also run Unix commands on UH Unix.

${{\color{Red}\normalsize{\textsf{Please be careful as some commands such as}}}}\$ `rm/rmdir` ${{\color{Red}\normalsize{\textsf{cannot be undone.}}}}\$

## 2. Create a directory for the assignment
Now you are going to write some code. Log in to UH Unix by SSH and you will be first placed in your home directory.

In default, the command prompt (the part before '%' in the terminal) shows your current location, but it does not always do. You may see something different if you have (somehow) changed the settings or you are working in an different shell environment. So you should be able to check the current location by running a Unix command. To check the current location, you can use `pwd`. The output should look like this.

```
uhx02:/home/t/tidota% pwd
/home/t/tidota
```

It would be troublesome if you create and use all of your files right under your home directory. To get organized, create a directory under your home directory and work in it. For this assignment, create a directory named `homework1`.

```
mkdir homework1
```

Then, go to the directory.

```
cd homework1
```

Now you are in the `homework1` directory. You will see that the prompt was changed like this.

```
uhx02:/home/t/tidota% cd homework1
uhx02:/home/t/tidota/homework1%
```

## 3. Run Java code
Download helloworld.java (right-click the link and choose "save link as..." or any relevant item on the context menu) and upload it to your directory on UH Unix (you can upload it by SFTP).

The Java code looks like this:
```
public class helloworld
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int num;
        int i;

        for (i = 0; i < 3; i = i + 1)
        {
            if (i < 1)
                System.out.println("Hello");
            else if (i < 2)
                System.out.println("World");
            else
                System.out.println("!!!");
        }

        num = 0;
        while (num < 4)
        {
            System.out.println("While loop!");
            num = num + 1;
        }

        num = 0;
        do
        {
            System.out.println("Do-while loop!");
            num = num + 1;
        }
        while (num < 3);
    }
}
```

Assuming you are in the same directory where `helloworld.java` is stored on UH Unix. Compile the code by this command.

```
javac helloworld.java
```

You should get `helloworld.class`. Then, run the Java program.

```
java helloworld
```

The program should print the following outputs.
```
Hello
World
!!!
While loop!
While loop!
While loop!
While loop!
Do-while loop!
Do-while loop!
Do-while loop!
```

## 4. Write C code
Now it's time to write your C code.

To write code, you can use text editors available on UH Unix: pico, nano, vi, and emacs.

To use vi,
```
vi homework1.c
```

If you want to use pico,
```
pico homework1.c
```

**Don't forget that you must follow the coding style.**

***If you want to use the template file,***
- Download template.c to your PC and then upload it to your directory on UH Unix

Now you have `template.c` in the current directory.
- Then, rename it as `homework1.c`. ${{\color{Red}\normalsize{\textsf{Note: If you already have}}}}\$ `homework1.c` ${{\color{Red}\normalsize{\textsf{, it will be overwritten.}}}}\$

```
mv template.c homework1.c
```

After that, your `homework1.c` contains template comments. **Make sure that you edit them so your code has proper information.**

If you prepared `homework1.c` correctly, it should look like the following:

```
/*****************************************************************
//
//  NAME:        ***Your Name***
//
//  HOMEWORK:    1
//
//  CLASS:       ICS 212
//
//  INSTRUCTOR:  
//
//  DATE:        January 1, 2021
//
//  FILE:        homework1.c
//
//  DESCRIPTION:
//   ***Explain the code in your words***
//
//
****************************************************************/

#include <stdio.h>

/*****************************************************************
//
//  Function name: main
//
//  DESCRIPTION:   ***Explain the function in your words***
//
//  Parameters:    argc (int) : number of arguments
//                 argv (char*[]): array of arguments
//
//  Return values:  0 : success
//
****************************************************************/

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    /* Write your code here */

    return 0;
}
```

In the main function, write C code to print the same output, i.e.,
```
Hello
World
!!!
While loop!
While loop!
While loop!
While loop!
Do-while loop!
Do-while loop!
Do-while loop!
```
${{\color{Red}\normalsize{\textsf{Note: the C code must have the equivalent program structure of the Java code
(for/while/do-while and if statements). Don't just put a line of printf to print the message above.}}}}\$

## 5. Compile your C code
After saving the file, compile it by `gcc` with `-ansi -pedantic-errors -Wall -c` options.
`gcc -ansi -pedantic-errors -Wall -c homework1.c`
Then, you will get an object file called `homework1.o`. If you get errors or warnings, find and correct problems in your code.

## 6. Link your object file
To generate an executable, link your object file by the same command.
`gcc -o homework1 homework1.o`

## 7. Execute your program
To execute your program, type "./" followed by the executable name.
`./homework1`

## 8. Proof of Compilation and Sample Output
Use [script](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~gini/1901-07s/files/script.html) command in UH Unix to record the terminal outputs, and show that you have used the correct compilation options and your program runs correctly on UH Unix.

${{\color{Red}\normalsize{\textsf{Warning 1: While running the script command, do not run any unrelated command,
which could modify the terminal format (e.g., text editor like pico). Otherwise, your file will be filled with 
many special characters that cannot be displayed correctly.}}}}\$

${{\color{Red}\normalsize{\textsf{Warning 2: We strongly recommend you to have a wide terminal window enough to
prevent text wrap. If you are using a narrow window and some texts are wrapped, the file may be corrupted and 
could not be graded.}}}}\$

- Proof of Compilation
Run `script` command with the file name to create.
`script proof.txt`
After that, compile and link your file. Then, run `exit` command to close and save the file.

Your terminal will look like this.
```
uhx02:/home/t/tidota/homework1% script proof.txt
Script started, file is proof.txt
uhx02:/home/t/tidota/homework1% gcc -ansi -pedantic-errors -Wall -c homework1.c
uhx02:/home/t/tidota/homework1% gcc -o homework1 homework1.o
uhx02:/home/t/tidota/homework1% javac helloworld.java
uhx02:/home/t/tidota/homework1% exit
exit
Script done, file is proof.txt
uhx02:/home/t/tidota/homework1%
```

Finally, you will get `proof.txt`.

${{\color{Red}\normalsize{\textsf{Verify the file by}}}}\$ `cat` ${{\color{Red}\normalsize{\textsf{command.}}}}\$
`cat proof.txt`

It will print its contents like this.
```
uhx02:/home/t/tidota/homework1% cat proof.txt
Script started on Sun 26 Jul 2020 02:58:14 AM HST
uhx02:/home/t/tidota/homework1% gcc -ansi -pedantic-errors -Wall -c homework1.c
uhx02:/home/t/tidota/homework1% gcc -o homework1 homework1.o
uhx02:/home/t/tidota/homework1% javac helloworld.java
uhx02:/home/t/tidota/homework1% exit
exit

Script done on Sun 26 Jul 2020 02:58:37 AM HST
uhx02:/home/t/tidota/homework1%
```

- Sample Output
After you generate an executable file, run `script` command with the file name to create.
`script output.txt`
After that, run your program. Then, run `exit` command to close and save the file.

Your terminal will look like this.
```
uhx02:/home/t/tidota/homework1% script output.txt
Script started, file is output.txt
uhx02:/home/t/tidota/homework1% ./homework1

```

${{\color{Red}\normalsize{\textsf{Verify the file by}}}}\$ `cat` ${{\color{Red}\normalsize{\textsf{command.}}}}\$
`cat output.txt`

It will print its contents like this.
```

## 9. Proof of Usage of Unix Commands
Show that you can now use Unix commands by following the steps below. ${{\color{Red}\normalsize{\textsf{Please be careful when you run}}}}\$ `rm` ${{\color{Red}\normalsize{\textsf{/}}}}\$ `rmdir` ${{\color{Red}\normalsize{\textsf{as they cannot be undone. Don't delete any important files such as your source file!!!!}}}}\$

- Go to the directory `homework1`
- Start `script` command to record the terminal output (the file name must be `unix_prac.txt`)
- Show the current working directory path by `pwd`
- Create a directory named `unix_prac`
- Copy the executable `homework1` to `unix_prac`
- Go to the directory `unix_prac`
- Rename the copied `homework1` to `hw1`
- Run the copied executable by `./hw1`
- Delete the copied executable
- Go back to `homework1`
- Delete the directory `unix_prac`
- Stop the recording
  
You will get `unix_prac.txt` and the contents should look like this (you can print it by `cat unix_prac.txt`)
```

## 📮 Materials to Submit
**On UH UNIX**, make a compressed tar file (a.k.a. tarball) containing the following files:
- Source Code (`homework1.c`)
- Proof of compilation (`proof.txt`)
- Output of the program (`output.txt`)
- Proof of Unix commands practice (`unix_prac.txt`)

## How to create a tarball
You can create it by running this command in the directory where those files exist. **Do not have any typo!!**

`tar zcvf homework1.tar.gz homework1.c proof.txt output.txt unix_prac.txt`

Then, you will get a file named `homework1.tar.gz`. **This is what you will submit.**

To check if the created tarball has the correct files,

`tar tvf homework1.tar.gz`

If the tarball was correctly created, it will print a list of files like this.
```
uhx02:/home/t/tidota/homework1% tar tvf homework1.tar.gz
-rw-r--r-- tidota/uh      1058 2020-07-26 02:49 homework1.c
-rw-r--r-- tidota/uh       350 2020-07-26 02:49 proof.txt
-rw-r--r-- tidota/uh       299 2020-07-26 02:49 output.txt
-rw-r--r-- tidota/uh       205 2020-07-26 02:49 unix_prac.txt
```

You may want to double check the data. For your practice, you may want to copy the tarball to another directory and try to extract files.

First, create a new directory `test` and copy the tarball there.

```
mkdir test
cp homework1.tar.gz ./test/
```

Then, go to the directory and extract files from the copied tarball.

```
cd test
tar zxvf homework1.tar.gz
```

To check the files you have in the current directory,
`ls -la`
The output will look like this.
```
uhx02:/home/t/tidota/homework1/test% ls -la
total 20
drwxr-xr-x. 2 tidota uh  102 Jul 26 02:52 .
drwxr-xr-x. 3 tidota uh  114 Jul 26 02:51 ..
-rw-r--r--. 1 tidota uh 1058 Jul 26 02:49 homework1.c
-rw-r--r--. 1 tidota uh  930 Jul 26 02:52 homework1.tar.gz
-rw-r--r--. 1 tidota uh  299 Jul 26 02:49 output.txt
-rw-r--r--. 1 tidota uh  350 Jul 26 02:49 proof.txt
-rw-r--r--. 1 tidota uh  205 Jul 26 02:49 unix_prac.txt
```

To check if the contents are correct, try to compile and run the code, and print out the contents in the text files.
